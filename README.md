# Stock-Market Workspace

Welcome to the Stock-Market workspace! This directory is intended for projects, scripts, data, and analyses related to the stock market.

## Getting Started

Since this is a new workspace, there are a few initial steps you'll likely want to take to set things up:

1.  **Install Python:** If you don't already have Python 3 installed, you'll need to download and install it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):** It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. This keeps your project's packages isolated from other projects.
    *   **Using `venv` (built-in):**
        ```bash
        
        python3 -m venv .venv  # Creates a virtual environment in the .venv directory

        source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
        
        .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
        
        ```
    *   **Using `conda` (if you have Anaconda/Miniconda):**
        
        ```bash
        
        conda create -n stock-market python=3.9 # Or your preferred Python version
        
        conda activate stock-market
        ```

3.  **Create Essential Directories:**  Let's create some standard directories to organize your work:

    ```bash
    mkdir data scripts notebooks models
    ```

    *   **`data/`:** This directory will store your stock market data (e.g., CSV files, JSON files, etc.).
    
    *   **`scripts/`:** This directory will hold your Python scripts for data collection, analysis, trading algorithms, etc.

4.  **Install Packages:** You'll likely need some Python packages for stock market analysis. Here are some common ones to get you started. You can install them with pip:
    
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib mariketstack requests
    ```

    *   **`pandas`:** For data manipulation and analysis.

    *   **`numpy`:** For numerical computing.

    *   **`matplotlib`:** For data visualization.

    *   **`marketstack`:** For downloading stock market data from MarketStack.

    *   **`requests`:** For making HTTP requests (useful for APIs).
    
5. **Create a requirements.txt file:**
    
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    
    ```    
    * This will save the packages you have installed to a file, so you can install them later.

6.  **API Keys (If Needed):** If you plan to use APIs to get stock data, you'll need to obtain API keys from the respective providers.

    *   **Store API keys securely:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory (outside of `data/`, `scripts/`, etc.) and add your API keys there.

    *   **Example `.env`:**
        ```
        API_KEY_ALPHA_VANTAGE=your_alpha_vantage_api_key
        API_KEY_FINNHUB=your_finnhub_api_key
        ```

    *   **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`:** This is crucial to prevent accidentally committing your API keys to version control.
    
7. **Create a .gitignore file:**
    
    ```bash
    touch .gitignore
    ```
    
    * Add the following to the file:    
    ```
    .env
    .venv
    __pycache__
    ```

    * This will prevent these files from being added to version control.

## Next Steps

Now that you've set up the basic structure, you can start working on your stock market projects:

*   **Data Collection:** Write scripts in the `scripts/` directory to download stock data and save it to the `data/` directory.

*   **Data Analysis:** Use Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore and analyze the data.

*   **Model Building:** If you're building predictive models, save them in the `models/` directory.

*   **Trading Algorithms:** Develop and test trading strategies in the `scripts/` directory.

## Best Practices

*   **Version Control (Git):** Use Git to track your changes and collaborate with others.

*   **Documentation:** Write clear and concise documentation for your code and projects.

*   **Testing:** Write tests to ensure the correctness of your code.

*   **Security:** Be mindful of security, especially when dealing with API keys and sensitive data.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Dependency Errors:** If you encounter errors related to missing packages, make sure your virtual environment is activated and that you've installed all the necessary packages.

*   **API Errors:** If you get errors related to API access, double-check your API keys and the API documentation.

This workspace is now ready for you to start building your stock market projects!
